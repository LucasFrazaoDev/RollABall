# RollABall
MiniGame in 3D URP

Project created by Unity 3D instructors

Project goals: Create a minigame with character movement, item collection and counting of collected items in the UI

Extras: Extended the play area for more movement, added a moving platform, a trigger for the wall to come down once you get all the items in the first zone,
a respawn point and a counter to increase the difficulty.
